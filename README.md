Social media communities reflect real-world sentiments, and analyzing their topical structure offers insight into information flow and diversity. Using BERTopic, we analyzed homogeneity and heterogeneity across 34 subreddits by collecting ~1,000 hot posts per community and extracting dominant themes. We represented each community with one-hot topic vectors and applied cosine similarity, clustering, and t-SNE/UMAP visualizations. Our results reveal clear differences in topic focus, uncovering latent community structures and patterns of homophily and heterophily.

CommentCrafter is a full-stack, LLM-powered platform that generates bulk synthetic user comments for training e-commerce comment filters. Users submit a product URL, desired comment count, and “pollution” level; the system infers product context, produces mock UGC, and assigns relevancy/offensiveness scores. Results can be exported (CSV/JSON/XML) and saved to view generation history. Built with a Flask + Firestore backend, Next.js/TypeScript frontend, and deployed via Docker on Google Cloud Run using Vertex AI (Gemini).

Built a full-stack IoT system that lets users securely open, close, and stop a garage door from a mobile app. The platform spans an embedded Raspberry Pi device, a cloud control plane, and a client application—designed to feel as responsive as a physical garage button while remaining remotely accessible with strong authentication and device ownership controls.
